      <h3>Welcome to the Self-Driving Car Simulation</h3>
      <p>This project simulates a self-driving car using a neural network. The car uses sensors to detect obstacles and makes
        decisions based on the neural network's outputs. Initially, the car might not perform well, but through trial and
        error, you can train the model to improve its performance.</p>
      <p>Here's what you can do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjust the number of cars and the variation in weights to train the model.</li>
        <li>Save the best car's brain if it performs well.</li>
        <li>Discard the saved brain to start fresh.</li>
        <li>Add more traffic to test the car's ability to navigate through obstacles.</li>
        <li>Reset the simulation if the car crashes or gets stuck.</li>
        <li>Change the number of lanes to see how the car adapts to different road conditions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Car Count</h3>
      <p>Simulation of model learning by choosing the traffic and making your own bestCar through Trial and Error. Set
        the
        number of cars (1-100) to train the model also the variation in weights (0-1) wrt the bestCar. This will reset
        the simulation
        with the specified number of cars. Then follow
        the steps for Model Training
      </p>

          <label for="carCount">Number of Cars:</label>
          <input type="number" id="carCount" min="1" max="100" value="1" title="Set the number of cars (1-100)">
        </div>
        <div>
          <label for="weightVariation">Weight Variation:</label>
          <input type="number" id="weightVariation" min="0" max="1" step="0.01" value="0.1"

      <button onclick="updateCarCount()" title="Update the number of cars">Update Car Count</button>

      <h3>Model Training</h3>
      <p>Save the best car's brain to improve the model over time(in case a car fails to navigate through traffic then
        save the best play of the alive car/ destroyed car). Discard the saved brain if you want to start fresh.
      </p>
      <div>

        <button onclick="save()" title="Save the best car's brain">üíæ Save</button>
        <button onclick="discard()" title="Discard the saved best car's brain">üóëÔ∏è Delete</button>
      </div>

      <h3>Traffic Control</h3>
      <p>Add more traffic cars(randomly generated) to test the self-driving car's ability to navigate through obstacles.
      </p>
      <button onclick="addTraffic()" title="Add more traffic cars">Add Traffic</button>

      <h3>Lane Count</h3>
      <p>Set the number of lanes for the road. This will reset the simulation with the specified number of lanes.</p>
      <div>
        <label for="laneCount">Number of Lanes:</label>
        <input type="number" id="laneCount" min="1" max="5" value="3" title="Set the number of lanes (1-10)">
      </div>
      <button onclick="updateLaneCount()" title="Update the number of lanes">Update Lane Count</button>

      <h3>Reset Simulation</h3>
      <p>Reset the simulation if the car crashes or gets stuck.</p>
      <button onclick="resetSimulation()" title="Reset the simulation">üîÑ Reset</button>

      <h3>Neural Network Simulation</h3>
      <p>The neural network always shows the simulation of the bestCar decision flow and consists of three layers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> 5 neurons representing the 5 sensor readings. The neurons get darker as the
          sensor gets closer to an object.</li>
        <li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> 4 neurons representing the car's actions(decision making of the carBrain):
          Forward (ü†â), Left (ü†à), Right
          (ü†ä), and Backward (ü†ã).</li>
        <li><strong>Middle Layer:</strong> 6 neurons representing the hidden layer of the neural network.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The connections between neurons are weighted, and the weights are adjusted during training to improve the car's
        performance.</p>
